I would like to thank my thesis advisor Professor Kang Li at The University of Georgia. Professor Li always answered my questions patiently whenever I ran into trouble of my research or had problems of implementing the projects. He consistently allowed this thesis to be my own work but steered me it in the right direction. More important, I learned a lot of research skills as well as presenting skills from him. I am sure that these skills will benefit me in my future career.

I would also like to thank my colleagues in Network System and Security Lab. Working with such a great team will always be my pleasure. We worked together to solve engineering problems also discussed our research together, which are mind refreshing and incredibly inspiring for me and even this thesis. 

Finally, I must express my very profound gratitude to my girlfriend Yunying Xu for providing me with unfailing support and continuous encouragement throughout my years of study and through the process of researching and writing this thesis. This accomplishment would not have been possible without her.

I hope this thesis will not be my final destination of academic research, and hope it is not just a hope.
